	<b class="SIP"> A. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY </b> <br><br> 
	The value of composting to communities and the environment may be aspects such as making plants thrive better, and be more healthy. With composting, our environment and plants will become healthier, 
	which will allow it to become more plentiful and bountiful. With this newly found abundance of harvest, the communities will benefit and find value out of it as well; by creating employment opportunities, and of course a source of food and agriculture.

	<b class="SIP"> B. STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM </b>
	<br><br> How will Phosphorous (Egg shells & Banana peels) compost affect the production of a Peanut plant? 
<br> <br> 
		</p> 

    <br><br>
	<b class="SIP"> C. Hypothesis </b>
	<br><br> If the Phosphorus compost is mixed with the soil then the peanut plant will produce more pods. 
<br> <br>
		</p>

	<br><br>
	<b class="SIP"> D. Review of the Related Literature </b> <br> 
    <br><br> Through research, we found that our plant, the peanut plant, heavily relies on composting for a healthy and bountiful harvest. The main nutrients that the peanut plant mostly requires is phosphorus, calcium, and potassium, all which are found in egg shells and banana peels. Calcium is essential for the peanut plant as it is what is responsible for holding both the cell walls, and the membrane within the plant cells. Calcium also acts as an intracellular messenger. Potassium is required for the plant as it allows the movement of water, nutrients, and carbohydrates within the plant tissue. Potassium is also involved with the enzyme activation in the plant, which in return affects the plant’s starch, protein, and ATP production, which is what regulates the plant’s rate of photosynthesis. These nutrients will help in the solving of our problem in wanting to affect our production of peanut pods.
